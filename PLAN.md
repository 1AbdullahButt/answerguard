# AnswerGuard: build plan (saved as PLAN.md after approval)

## Context
A fresh folder (`D:\Project\slite`) holds only `SPEC.md` v2.2, `IMPLEMENTATION_BRIEF.md` and `KICKOFF_PROMPT.md`. The goal is AnswerGuard: a Next.js/TypeScript demo where live AI pulls claims out of messy docs and a pure, traced rules engine returns Allow/Caution/Hold/Escalate on a support agent's draft reply. It ships as a public Vercel URL and serves as a portfolio piece for Slite. The build is driven by a gated agent loop (subagents + Node hooks) through Phases 0–4. SPEC wins over the brief.

Environment checked (read-only): Node 22.23, npm 10.9, corepack 0.34, git 2.55, gh logged in as `1AbdullahButt` (scopes include `repo` and `workflow`, so CI can be pushed), Vercel CLI 65.5, ffmpeg 9 (for the demo GIF). **pnpm is not installed.** There is no `.env.local`. The repo name `answerguard` is free on GitHub.

## Standing rules (go into CLAUDE.md)
The 7 rules from brief §7, plus rule 8, **no git worktrees**:
- Work directly in `D:\Project\slite` on `main`.
- Never run `git worktree add`, and never create sibling folders (e.g. `slite-b2`).
- For risky work, `git switch -c <branch>` in this folder. Merge back to `main` when the gate passes, delete the branch, then push.
- At the end of every phase, `git worktree list` must show only `D:\Project\slite`. Paste its output into PROGRESS.md as part of the gate evidence.
- Subagents are spawned **without** `isolation: "worktree"`.

## 1. Agent loop (built first, before Phase 0 code)
- **`.claude/agents/`**
  - `designer.md`: Phase 3 only. Writes `design/DESIGN.md` and 3 static HTML mockups.
  - `builder.md`: implements to SPEC. Never touches locked paths. Reads `.loop/qa-findings.md` when fixing.
  - `tester.md`: in Phase 0, writes T1–T8, the fixtures and the cache-identity test. After that it only runs tests and pastes the raw output.
  - `qa.md`: independent reviewer. Runs the tests and the app itself, checks SPEC acceptance and the phase gate, and writes `.loop/qa-findings.md` (file, line, expected vs actual, severity) ending in `VERDICT: APPROVED | CHANGES_REQUIRED`.
- **`.claude/hooks/protect-locked.mjs`** (PreToolUse; matcher `Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Bash|PowerShell`). PowerShell and NotebookEdit are added because this machine exposes them and they would otherwise bypass the lock.
  - Inactive until `.loop/locked` exists.
  - Normalizes `\` to `/`, lowercases, and resolves paths relative to the project.
  - Blocks writes to `tests/`, `SPEC.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_BRIEF.md`, `data/seed/`, plus extra paths listed one per line inside `.loop/locked` (used to add `e2e/` in Phase 3).
  - For shell commands, blocks the following when they target a locked path: `rm`/`del`/`Remove-Item`/`rmdir`, `mv`/`move`/`Move-Item`/`ren`, `cp`/`Copy-Item` into it, `>`/`>>`/`Out-File`/`Set-Content`/`Add-Content`/`tee`, `sed -i`, `git checkout|restore|rm|mv -- <locked>`, and `git worktree add` (blocked always, enforcing rule 8).
  - Exits 2 with a message naming the path and saying "locked by SPEC; write .loop/BLOCKER.md if a test is wrong".
- **`.claude/hooks/gate-stop.mjs`** (Stop).
  - Reads the current phase from `.loop/phase`. With no file, the loop is inactive and stopping is allowed.
  - Allows a stop if `.loop/await-human.md` or `.loop/BLOCKER.md` exists, or if PROGRESS.md's `## Phase N` section contains `GATE: PASSED` **and** at least one fenced evidence block.
  - Otherwise returns `{"decision":"block","reason":…}` naming the next loop step, inferred from state: no qa-findings → run tester+qa; `CHANGES_REQUIRED` → builder fixes; and so on.
- **`.claude/commands/build.md`** (`/build`).
  - Loop: builder → tester (real output) → qa → fix from findings → repeat.
  - Tracks attempts per issue in `.loop/attempts.json`. On the 5th failure of the same issue, it writes `.loop/BLOCKER.md` and stops.
  - A gate passes only when the tests pass **and** QA says APPROVED. On a pass: update PROGRESS.md, scan for secrets, commit "Phase N: gate passed", push, bump `.loop/phase`.
- **`.claude/settings.json`** registers both hooks with `node .claude/hooks/<x>.mjs`.
- **Canary.**
  - Create `.loop/locked`, then try a real Edit on `tests/…`, a Bash `rm tests/…` and a PowerShell `Remove-Item tests\…`.
  - Also pipe synthetic JSON with backslash paths through the hook using node.
  - Paste the blocked outputs into PROGRESS.md.

## 2. GitHub
1. `git init -b main` and `.gitignore` as specified.
2. Commit the docs (SPEC, brief, kickoff, PLAN.md, CLAUDE.md, the agent kit).
3. `gh repo create answerguard --private --source . --push`.
4. **Secret gate before every commit:** run `git diff --cached` and grep for `sk-ant-`, `gho_`/`ghp_`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=.+` and generic `(api[_-]?key|token|secret)\s*[:=]\s*\S{12,}`. A hit aborts the commit. This is wrapped in `scripts/precommit-scan.mjs`, also installed as `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
5. Every passed gate gets a commit and push named "Phase N: gate passed", followed by `git worktree list` evidence.
6. CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `pnpm test` plus the Playwright e2e with `AI_MODE=saved`.

## 3. Phases

### Phase 0: setup and lock
- **pnpm**: install with `corepack enable pnpm`, falling back to `npm i -g pnpm`. Recorded in DECISIONS.md.
- **Hand-scaffold** Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19, TS strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`). `create-next-app` refuses a non-empty folder. Files: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, `.env.example`.
- **Dependencies**: zod, lucide-react, @anthropic-ai/sdk, @upstash/ratelimit, @upstash/redis, vitest, @playwright/test.
- **Seed data, Appendix A verbatim**:
  - `data/seed/docs/{DOC-101,DOC-103,SRC-202,DOC-104,DOC-105}.md` hold the bodies.
  - `sources.json` holds the metadata.
  - `tickets.json` holds the tickets.
  - Bodies are copied byte-exact from SPEC (en dashes, emoji, HTML comment).
- **Test seams and stubs.**
  - The gate needs tests to *fail on behaviour, not imports*, so Phase 0 writes `lib/engine/types.ts` (exact SPEC 6.2/6.3/12 interfaces).
  - It also writes stub modules that `throw new Error("NOT_IMPLEMENTED")`:
    - `lib/check/runCheck.ts`: `runCheck(input, deps)`
    - `lib/check/handlers.ts`: `handleCheck(body, deps)` and `handleSend(body, deps)`, returning `{status, body}`
    - `lib/engine/decide.ts`
    - `lib/ai/cache.ts`
  - `deps = { extractDraft, extractSource, suggestReply?, now }`. This is how fixtures and the T5 spy get injected. The route files become thin wrappers in Phase 1.
- **Tests (tester agent)** in `tests/engine/t1-hold … t8-extraction-gap.test.ts`, plus `tests/ai/cache-identity.test.ts`.
  - The cache-identity test is written now because `tests/` locks at the end of this phase. It is expected to fail until Phase 2.
  - Fixtures go in `tests/fixtures/extractions/*.json`: every seed source, every B-variant needed, the drafts, a DOC-104 without the injection line, and error markers for T8(b/c).
  - All tests use a fixed `decisionTime` of 2026-10-30.
- **Before locking**, QA reviews the tests line-by-line against SPEC §14. A wrong locked test would need you to unlock it.
- Then create `.loop/locked` and run the canary.
- **Gate evidence**:
  - raw `pnpm test` output: 9 files run; T1–T8 fail with `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` or assertion errors, and no import or syntax errors
  - the canary outputs
  - QA APPROVED
  - `git worktree list`

### Phase 1: rules engine (no AI code)
- **Engine modules**:
  - `lib/engine/{standing,applicability,resolve,decide,patterns,normalize,severity}.ts`
  - `lib/workspace/{seed,merge,permissions}.ts`
  - `lib/check/runCheck.ts` and `handlers.ts`
  - `lib/replies/templates.ts`
- **Thin routes**: `app/api/{seed,check,send}/route.ts`, with zod-validated bodies.
- Every rule appends a trace entry.
- Permissions filter **before** any extraction.
- **Safe-reply recheck**: the HOLD template is rechecked with a deterministic draft claim (we wrote the span ourselves), so no AI call is needed. The ESCALATE template is asserted to have no digits, no day/hour words and no detector hit.
- **Gate**: T1–T8 pass on fixtures (raw output pasted) + typecheck + QA APPROVED + worktree list. The cache test may still fail, and that is noted.

### Phase 2: live AI
- **Pause rule**: no `.env.local` key exists today. I first build everything that doesn't need a key: prompts, schemas, `validateQuote`, the cache with identity files, the limiter (in-memory now, Upstash-ready), the record/eval scripts, and golden.json. Then I write `.loop/await-human.md` and stop.
- **Files**: `lib/ai/{client,prompts,schemas,extractSource,extractDraft,suggestReply,cache,validateQuote}.ts`, `lib/rateLimit.ts`, `scripts/{record-ai-cache,eval}.ts`, `evals/golden.json`, `evals/results.md`, `data/ai-cache/*.json`.
- **Structured output**: tool schema → zod → retry once → reject. I'll load the `claude-api` skill first for the current Haiku 5.5 structured-output API.
- **golden.json has 12 cases**:
  - 3 canonical tickets
  - B1–B7
  - TCK-9001 with a "1 business day" draft (ALLOW)
  - a draft with no claim (ALLOW `NO_POLICY_CLAIM`)
- The eval bypasses the cache so all 3 runs are real calls.
- **Gate**:
  - `pnpm eval` shows the canonical tickets plus B1, B2, B3 and B7 correct on 3/3 runs (spec gate ∪ brief gate)
  - cache recorded
  - with the key unset and `AI_MODE=saved`, canonical results reproduce (output pasted)
  - full test suite including the cache test passes
  - QA APPROVED
  - If the eval fails: fix the prompts or schema only.

### Phase 3: design, then UI
- **Designer** writes `design/DESIGN.md` and 3 mockups (HOLD + Check tab, Reasoning expanded, Sources editing). I take Playwright screenshots of the mockups, then write `.loop/await-human.md` and **stop for your approval**.
- **After approval**:
  - The tester writes `e2e/demo.spec.ts` (role/label selectors), and `e2e/` is appended to `.loop/locked`.
  - The builder builds the components listed in brief §3: shell, inbox, panel with 4 tabs, states (empty, checking with progress steps, AI unavailable, rate-limited, invalid output), and responsive slide-over/bottom sheet.
  - Every screen gets the disclaimer footer, and there are no Slite brand assets.
- **Gate**:
  - Playwright e2e passes in saved mode
  - QA screenshots each state at 1440/1024/390 and compares them with the mockups
  - axe-core accessibility scan: no serious or critical issues
  - QA APPROVED

### Phase 4: send, metrics, deploy
- `/api/send` blocked UI (409 inline, CAUTION ack checkbox, 503 retry).
- Impact tab (3 metrics, n<3 guard, "Simulated · this browser").
- 5-step skippable tour.
- README with an architecture diagram, the AI-vs-rules table and eval numbers.
- GIF from a Playwright video converted with ffmpeg.
- **Then I write `.loop/await-human.md` and stop** for:
  - Vercel login/link
  - Upstash via the Marketplace
  - a dedicated Anthropic workspace, key and spend limit, plus whether it is a hard stop
  - setting env vars
- Afterwards I deploy and run QA against the **deployed** URL, using SPEC §18 item by item (mobile viewport smoke test).
- The narrated 4-minute walkthrough video is yours to record. I'll provide the script and the tour.

## 4. Risks, mainly live extraction
| Risk | Effect | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| DOC-101 "Do NOT promise same day" extracted as a second claim | A same-day candidate disagrees inside DOC-101 → TCK-9003 ESCALATE | The prompt says negated/prohibited statements are not claims. An eval case catches it. |
| SRC-202 scoped `any` instead of `instant` | D11(b) fires on TCK-9003 → false CAUTION | Scope prompt rule. Eval on TCK-9003. |
| Model writes `-` for the en dash in "Outgoing Transfers – Reversal SOP" | QUOTE_NOT_FOUND kills the supersession → falls to D6 (still HOLD, but the D5 trace story breaks) | See Q2. |
| B2 still says "reversed within 1 business day" assertively | Model labels it `in_force` → HOLD instead of CAUTION | statusWording examples. The whole doc's status line governs. |
| Scope taken from a title (B3) | ESCALATE becomes HOLD | Prompt rule. Fallback is a `scopeQuote` field validated as a substring. |
| Model invents `effectiveFrom` from "reviewed in Sept" | Could disturb D5 condition 4 | Prompt: only explicit "Effective …" dates. |
| Temperature 0 is still not perfectly deterministic | 3/3 can flake | Tighten prompts and enum descriptions. Never touch rules or tests. |
| A locked test turns out to be wrong | Loop cannot fix it | QA reviews before the lock. Otherwise BLOCKER → you. |
| B5 "future" date goes stale | Demo breaks later | Use 2030-01-01 in the variant. |
| Public URL cost | Spend | Layered limits per SPEC 10. Cache hits are free. |

## 5. Spec ambiguities: my default unless you say otherwise
1. **Q1 "Contradicts" across units (D11(b), D1, D4).** Brief §5 makes SRC-202's "1 day" calendar days. If a unit difference counts as a contradiction, T6 (1 business day, instant → ALLOW) becomes CAUTION CHANGE_SIGNALLED. Default: D11(b) compares **amount ranges only** (unit-only differences are noted in the trace). D4/D1 "agree" requires the same amount and unit.
2. **Q2 Quote normalization.** SPEC says "normalize whitespace". Default: whitespace + NFKC + folding dash/quote variants (– — ‑ → -, smart quotes → straight), applied to both sides. Documented as a stated extension.
3. **Q3 D0b vs D0c overlap.** A draft with only "24 hours" (topic `other`) matches both. Default: if every detector match falls inside an extracted claim's span → D0c `OUTSIDE_COVERAGE`. Any uncovered match → D0b `EXTRACTION_GAP`.
4. **CheckResult has no overall reason field** for D0a/b/d or the `SOURCE_UNREAD` cap. Default: extend it, without changing existing fields, with `reasonCode`, `caps[]` and `patternMatches[]`.
5. **Hedged contradiction** has no reason code. Default: `HEDGED_CONTRADICTION` (CAUTION).
6. **Supersession title match.** The metadata title says "Outgoing Transfers: Reversal SOP" while the text says "– Reversal SOP". Default normalization: lowercase, every non-alphanumeric run → one space, then containment.
7. **T5 "no substring of its body"** taken literally (any one character) is untestable. Default: no line of the body ≥ 12 chars, no title, no `DOC-105`/`FR-HOLD`/`CMP-7`, and no visible-source count reveals hidden sources.
8. **Phase 2's cache test** must go into locked `tests/`, so it is written in Phase 0. `e2e/` is locked after it is written in Phase 3.
9. **Next.js 15** per the brief (not 16), pinned.

## 6. Questions for you
- Are defaults Q1–Q3 OK? Those three change outcomes. The rest are cosmetic.
- Is it OK to install pnpm globally (corepack or npm -g)?
- GitHub repo `answerguard`, private, under `1AbdullahButt`: confirm.

## Verification summary
Every gate pastes raw command output (`pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm eval`, `pnpm e2e`, `git worktree list`) plus the QA verdict into PROGRESS.md. The Stop hook refuses to end a phase without `GATE: PASSED` plus an evidence block. The final gate is QA against the deployed Vercel URL, using SPEC §18.

## 7. Amendments after approval (2026-10-30)
- **AI provider → Groq** (amends SPEC §10, recorded in DECISIONS.md; SPEC.md untouched).
  `lib/ai/client.ts` is a provider adapter: `AI_PROVIDER=groq` (default) uses Groq's OpenAI-compatible
  Chat Completions API with JSON-schema structured output; `AI_PROVIDER=anthropic` keeps an Anthropic
  adapter, off by default. Env: `GROQ_API_KEY`, `GROQ_MODEL`, `AI_PROVIDER`. Provider and model are part
  of the cache identity. Groq 429 → saved responses + "Live AI paused" badge.
  If the eval cannot reach 3/3 with Groq after prompt fixes → `.loop/await-human.md`, do not switch models/providers.
- Phase 2 pause condition is now "no `GROQ_API_KEY`" (present, so no pause).
- Open questions answered by default: Q1–Q3 defaults adopted; pnpm installed via corepack; repo `answerguard` private.

## 8. Phase 5: Design v2 (added 2026-10-31, approved by Abdullah)
Brief: `design/v2/REDESIGN_PROMPT.md`; artboards `design/v2/*.dc.html`; contract `design/v2/UI-CONTRACT.md`; D-026.
- Restyle and simplify the UI to design v2 (Send runs the check, 3 cards, 2 tabs, plain outcome names, Demo menu, v2 tokens,
  responsive, tour copy). Engine, AI pipeline, API and engine tests unchanged.
- One-time unlock of the demo test folder; the tester rewrites the spec for the same journey; QA compares it with the old
  test; re-lock afterwards.
- **Gate:** typecheck, full test suite, rewritten e2e and the axe audit (1440/1024/390: 0 serious/critical, no horizontal
  scroll, AA contrast) all pass; screenshots of each v2 state at 1440 and 390 compared side by side with the artboards by QA;
  QA APPROVED; re-locked; deployed to Vercel production and smoke-tested (desktop + phone); `git worktree list` clean.
