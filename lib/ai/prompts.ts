${DATA_RULE}

Extract every affirmative statement of a timeline or other value the document makes, including proposals, plans and
announced future changes (those are claims too, with statusWording "proposed" or "pending_approval"). Output one claim per statement.
${TAXONOMY}
${VALUE_RULES}

Rules, follow exactly:
1. quote: copy one contiguous run of characters from the document that states the claim, exactly as it appears (same
   dashes, apostrophes, capitalisation). Start and end inside a single sentence or line. Do not paraphrase, shorten with
   "...", merge sentences, or add or remove characters. Leave out labels, list markers and markdown formatting around the
   sentence: from '**Failed transfer:** "Sorry! Refunds take 5-7 days."' quote only 'Refunds take 5-7 days.'
2. Negations and prohibitions are NOT claims. "Do NOT promise same day" states no reversal window; skip it. Do not extract
   "same day" from it. A plan to change a timeline is NOT a negation: "we're planning to move instant reversals to 1 day
   once compliance signs off. Not live yet" IS a claim: reversal_window, 1 day, rail instant, statusWording "proposed".
3. rail (scope): use ONLY explicit text in the body: "instant-rail transfers only", "for instant reversals", "instant reversals" → "instant"; "standard transfers" → "standard"; "all rails" or no rail restriction → "any". A heading or document title alone is NOT scope: if only the title mentions a rail and the sentence does not, use "any".
   If a document's scope section says "(all rails)", its claims are "any".
4. statusWording describes the claim's status as the document states it:
   - "Effective <date>", "Approved by …", "in force", a plain statement of current procedure with an approval → "in_force".
   - "planning to", "proposal", "proposed change", "moving … once X signs off" → "proposed".
   - "pending sign-off", "pending approval", "not approved yet", "do not use until … confirms" → "pending_approval". A pending/not-approved line anywhere in the document governs every claim in it, even if a later sentence is phrased as fact.
   - "deprecated", "no longer applies", "replaced by" (about itself) → "deprecated".
   - nothing stated → "unstated".
5. effectiveFrom: ISO date only from an explicit "Effective <date>" statement (e.g. "Effective 27 Oct 2026" → "2026-10-27"). Review dates, edit dates and "last reviewed in Sept" are NOT effective dates → null.
6. supersedes: only when the text explicitly says this document supersedes/replaces/overrides something. targetText = what it names (copied); quote = that exact sentence. Otherwise null.
7. If the document makes no claims, return {"claims": []}.`;

2. A promise about when money from a failed transfer comes back (refund, reversal, "back in your wallet", "your money will be back") is "reversal_window".
3. definitive: false when hedged: "usually", "typically", "around", "about", "should", "we're checking", "might". Otherwise true.
4. Greetings, apologies and promises to follow up with no value are not claims.
